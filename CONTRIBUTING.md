_Exercises  / examples_

Please add as many exercises and examples to this repo, the `master` branch is the place to put your exercises that need to be solved. Or examples that have comments on what it is doing, or how to use a JDK9 features or how it has been used across the whole project. Have a look at how we have already created some of the exercises under the [Session 3: Refactoring/migration sessions](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jdk9-jigsaw/tree/master/session-3-refactoring-migration).
If you know of a feature or cool trick in JDK 9, then this is the place to put it.

##### Testing

Test your work under the respective platforms i.e. Linux, Mac and Windows, if not, please specify in your pull request which platforms need testing and what to do.

##### Platform coverage

Try to always provide exercises / examples / solutions for all three platforms, otherwise please let us know the platforms which are not covered. 

#### Pull Requests 

Ensure solutions to exercises are placed in the `exercise-solutions` branch. Typically examples can be (and should) be placed in both `master` and `exercise-solutions` branches.

We also have branches called `ant-version`, and `maven-branch` which is a near-literal translation of the exercises in the `master` branch into the respective build systems.
